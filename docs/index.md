# Campus Event Management System

A **production-ready** Campus Event Management System showcasing the complete transformation from a simple Python project to a modern, CI/CD-integrated application with enterprise-grade development practices.

## 🎯 Project Highlights

This project demonstrates a **complete CI/CD migration** featuring:

- ✅ **Modern Python Packaging** (`pyproject.toml` with UV)
- ✅ **Comprehensive CI/CD Pipeline** (5 specialized GitHub Actions workflows)
- ✅ **Automated Code Quality** (Black, isort, flake8, mypy, pylint)
- ✅ **Multi-Layer Security** (Bandit, Safety, CodeQL, Trivy scanning)
- ✅ **Professional Documentation** (MkDocs Material with automated deployment)
- ✅ **Containerization** (Docker with multi-stage builds)
- ✅ **Development Automation** (20+ Make targets, setup scripts)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### One-Command Setup
